##Episode-4 Talk is Cheap, show me the code

   
## Theory - 
- Is `JSX` mandatory for React?
- Is `ES6` mandatory for React?
- {TitleComponent} vs `<TitleComponent/>` vs `<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>` in JSX
- How can I wrire comments in JSX?
- What is `<React.Fragment><React.Fragment/>` and <></>?
- What is `Virtual DOM`?
- What is Reconciliation in React?
- What is React Fibre?
- Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?

## Coding-
- Build a Food ordering App
   - Think of a cool name for your App
   - Build a AppLayout
   - Build a Header Component with Logo & Nav Items & Cart
   - Build a Body Component
      - Build Restaurant List Component
      - Build Restaurant Card Component
        - Use static data initially
        - Make your card dynamic(pass in props)
          - Props - passing arguments to a function - Use Destructring & spread operator
        - Render your cards with dynamic data of restaurants
        - Use Array.map to render all the restaurants
 PS. Basically do everything that I did in class, in the same sequence. Don't skip small things.
